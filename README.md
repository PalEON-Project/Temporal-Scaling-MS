Abstract
Terrestrial ecosystem models are useful in their ability to not only accurately predict ecosystem states at specific points in time, but to understand how ecosystem respond to changing conditions through time.  Often the greatest interest in model output lies in assessing the accuracy of a modeled ecosystem state at a given time, but this may be an artifact of model parameterization.  Comparing what drives ecosystem change in through time in reality and in models can provide insights into the underlying processes and model structures that generate states.  However, the drivers of ecosystem change can depend on temporal scale.  The processes and environmental drivers that govern seasonal or interannual variation change in NPP or AGB may not be the same processes responsible for changes in these ecosystem characteristics at decadal or centennial time scales.  Understanding the temporal scalability of models and in situ ecosystem processes can provide insight into at what time scales terrestrial ecosystem models are currently most useful.

Planned Analyses:
For all of the analyses outlined below, I’d like to use an above and below ground carbon flux, an above ground and below ground carbon pool, a “linking” variable like LAI, and then another variable like transpiration or an energy flux to provide a more direct tie-in with ecosystem services.

Assessment of Ecosystem Properties
Ecosystem properties generally refers to the state of ecosystem pools and fluxes at any given point in time
1) Model validation where modeled values for variables like AGB, NPP, and transpiration to observed values from direct observation at the model sites as well as ranges pulled from the literature to provide context for “reasonable” ranges for the systems we’re modeling. (example figures in figure folder)
2) Comparing the relative sizes of different pools and fluxes within a model.  For example, if the actual values of of AGB or NPP in ED are vastly different from what the literature suggests is reasonable, are at least the relationships of fluxes (e.g. NPP to transpiration or LAI) or carbon pools (e.g. ratio of above- to below-ground carbon storage) similar to what we observe in ecosystems.

Assessment of Ecosystem Change
This analysis will look at how model drivers (e.g. meteorology) and autogenic processes (succession) drive variation in ecosystem characteristics (i.e. model variables; NPP, AGB, etc) at three different time scales: annual, decadal, centennial  
Analyses will include: (note: examples provided are purely hypothetical)
  1) assessing variation in temporal autocorrelation among models and ecosystem properties (AGB, LAI, soil carb...) and determining at which time scales models show the greatest and least agreement in general patterns 
      (i.e. do models generally agree when biomass goes up & down at centennial time scales, while climate-ecosystem variation at annual time scales is purely driven by model idiosyncracies?)
      1b) including empirical data sets (tree rings!) to see if the autocorrelation of the models is similar to that observed in different empirical data sources
  2) Quantifying the primary drivers of ecosystem variation in each model and comparison with empirical(example figure in figures folder)
      (i.e. ED may be driven by annual temperature while LPJ is driven by precip)
      2b) comparison of driver sensitivities and changes in sensitivity with temporal scale with empirical data
  3) understanding the "community dynamics" of models: can we use the information gained in previous analyses about model sensitivity to individual drivers to help understand differences in model predictions.  Currently planning on using some sort of ordination where the ordination "observations" will be along the lines of percent change in NPP per degree change in temperature   (example figure in figures folder.)
