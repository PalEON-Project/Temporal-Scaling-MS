Abstract
When running ecosystem models for long periods of time into the future or the past, there is little to no emprical data available to evaluate the accuracy of model projections of ecosystem state (i.e. biomass, NPP, etc).  Rather than focus on the absolute values of model projections for a given point in time, we can instead investivate what drives changes in the model and compare these patterns of model sensitivity to climate.  However, the patterns we observe may be scale-dependent.

Analyses:
1) Model sesntivity to climate drivers (set of climate drivers is model-specific)
    a) Baseline Effect: Annual Resolution, full temporal extent (850-2010)
    b) Change in Temporal Resolution: Full temporal extent, but working with 10-, 50-, or 100-year means
    c) Change in Temporal Extent: Annual resolution, but working with data from 1850- or 1990-2010
2) Comparisons with Empirical Data
    a) Tree rings -- note this requires a subset of sites & temporal extent, so it's important to understand the implications of these changes in scale from part 1.
